Hi!

These slides are created by one HTML file `index.html`

The other directories are required for the presentation, so
to prepare a machine to give this presentation, this entire
directory should be unpacked somewhere.

The presentation runs in Safari or Chrome directly, and does
not need to be served by NPM.

Please try it out and let me know immediately if something doesn't
look right.
